Introduction
This repository showcases the projects developed during the data science bootcamp. Each project demonstrates different techniques and skills essential for a data scientist, from basic regression models to complex deep learning networks and data visualization.

Projects
1. Regression Analysis
This project includes various types of regression analyses:

Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
These analyses are performed using sklearn and statsmodels libraries.

2. Cluster Analysis
This project involves different clustering techniques, primarily using KMeans from the sklearn library. The aim is to group data points into clusters based on their features.

3. MNIST Digit Classification
This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model achieves an accuracy of 97.33%.

4. Audiobook Case Study
This case study involves using a CNN to classify whether an individual is likely to repurchase a book. This model can help in targeting individuals for marketing campaigns.

5. Absenteeism Case Study
This project uses logistic regression to predict if an individual is likely to be excessively absent. The project also includes visualization of the data using Tableau.
