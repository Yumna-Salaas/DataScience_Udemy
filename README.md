## Introduction

This repository showcases the projects developed during the data science bootcamp. Each project demonstrates different techniques and skills essential for a data scientist, from basic regression models to complex deep-learning networks and data visualization.

## Projects

### 1. Regression Analysis

This project includes various types of regression analyses:

- Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression

These analyses are performed using sklearn and statsmodels libraries.

### 2. Cluster Analysis

This project involves different clustering techniques, primarily using KMeans from the sklearn library. The aim is to group data points into clusters based on their features.

### 3. MNIST Digit Classification

This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model achieves an accuracy of 97.33%.

### 4. Audiobook Case Study

This case study involves using a CNN to classify whether an individual is likely to repurchase a book. This model can help in targeting individuals for marketing campaigns.

### 5. Absenteeism Case Study

This project uses logistic regression to predict if an individual is likely to be excessively absent. The project also includes visualization of the data using Tableau.
