## Introduction

This repository showcases the projects developed during the data science bootcamp. Each project demonstrates different techniques and skills essential for a data scientist, from basic regression models to complex deep-learning networks and data visualization.

## Projects

### 1. Regression Analysis

The projects include various types of regression analyses:

- Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression

These analyses are performed using Scikit-learn and Statsmodels libraries.

### 2. Cluster Analysis

The project uses KMeans and Dendrogram clustering from the Scikit-learn library. The aim is to group data points into clusters based on their features. The market segmentation case study uses Cluster analysis to maximize the output of a marketing campaign. 

### 3. MNIST Digit Classification

This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation, achieving an accuracy of 97.33%. The high accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning techniques for image classification tasks.

### 4. Audiobook Case Study

This case study uses a CNN to classify whether an individual will likely repurchase a book. This model can help in targeting individuals for marketing campaigns. The project uses a similar approach to the MNIST problem. However, the preprocessing is different as the data set dealt with in this problem is a *.CSV file. 

### 5. Absenteeism Case Study

This project uses logistic regression to predict if an individual is likely to be excessively absent. This project involves 4 different steps:

- Preprocessing: Understanding, cleaning, and validating the data
- Machine Learning: Building the logistic regression model and fine-tuning. Using the pickle library to save the model and scaler
- Module and Integration: Creating the module and using it on new data using the model and scaler to prepare it for visualization
- Data Visualizing: Visualizing the final predicted data using Tableau to get insights.
